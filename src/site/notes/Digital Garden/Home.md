# Working Notes

Hi! I’m [Kaj Visser](https://kaj.me/). You’ve stumbled upon my working notes. They’re kind of strange, so some context might help.

These notes are mostly written for myself: they’re roughly my thinking environment ([[Evergreen notes|Evergreen notes]]; [[My morning writing practice|My morning writing practice]]). But I’m sharing them publicly as an experiment ([[Work with the garage door up|Work with the garage door up]]). If a note seems confusing or under-explained, it’s probably because I didn’t write it for you! Sorry—that’s sort of an essential tension of this experiment ([[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience|Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]).

For now, there’s no index or navigational aids: you’ll need to follow a link to some starting point. You might be interested in [[What’s top of mind|What’s top of mind]].
